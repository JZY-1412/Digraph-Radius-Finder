# Digraph-Radius-Finder
A simple C++ program used for finding the digraph radius parallely.

This C++ program uses OpenMP to implement BFS and finds the radius of digraphs.

## Input

The input should be in the following format:

3

1 2

2

0

0

The first "3" indicates the digraph has 3 vertices.

The following 3 lines indicates the connections, For example the "1 2" indicates vertex 0 connect to vertex 1 and vertex 2.

The last "0" indicates the end of input (pragram will finish).

## output

The output will be the radius of each digraph inputed.

The output also contains the elapsed time.

## Test Cases

The python program could be used to produce test cases.

Some test cases is also uploaded.
